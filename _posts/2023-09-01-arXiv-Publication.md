## DEVELOPING A ROBOT THAT GIVES DIRECTIONS LIKE A HUMAN
As a master student at Heriot-Watt University, I recently worked on an interesting project to develop a robot that can give natural language directions to humans. Our robot, called FurNav, is built on a Furhat social robot that has a projected face capable of human-like expressions and gestures.

In our published paper, we investigate two methods FurNav can use to guide people around a map: giving directions based on landmarks like “turn right at the red sofa”, or more skeletal abstract instructions like “turn right”.

Our team sees promise in FurNav’s ability to provide natural landmark-based directions. The next phase involves deploying an updated version across a larger indoor space and testing it with additional users. We hope continued progress in this area leads to robots capable of giving clear route guidance that makes people feel at ease.

I’m proud to work on cutting-edge projects that advance robots’ communication abilities and their perception by human collaborators. Research like this moves us toward more capable and helpful robot assistants.
