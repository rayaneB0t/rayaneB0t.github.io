## Introduction

The thesis explores the impact of advanced AI language models, such as ChatGPT, on human-robot interaction (HRI), specifically focusing on the Furhat robot's integration with ChatGPT to enhance its communication capabilities. It includes a detailed methodology, scenario overview, and setup for the experiment, along with the results and discussions. The study aims to advance understanding of AI-enhanced communication in HRI and its potential implications for various industries. The document also discusses the significance of the study, research objectives, and the technical capabilities of the Furhat robot.

## Research Objectives
The thesis sets forth clear objectives, aiming to implement ChatGPT within the Furhat robot platform to create a more dynamic and naturalistic interaction model. It seeks to examine the effects of this integration on user trust and engagement during interactions with the Furhat robot. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT-enhanced communication in HRI through user studies and qualitative feedback, offering significant insights into AI-enhanced communication in HRI.

## Methodology
The methodology section outlines the technical capabilities of the Furhat robot, including its advanced motion platform, onboard cameras, microphones, projection system for facial animations, and customizable face mask. These features enable Furhat to convey a range of emotions and reactions, mirroring human-like expressions. The scenario overview and experiment setup are meticulously detailed, providing a clear framework for the study. The objective and tasks, detailed task breakdown, physical setup for the experiment, and the role of Furhat and integration of trust scales are all elaborated upon, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the experimental design.

## Results and Discussions
The study reveals diverse user preferences when interacting with AI systems like Furhat, highlighting the significance of modifiable modes of interaction and the role of trust in AI systems. It underscores the need for improved communication strategies that emulate human-human interactions and discusses the integration of AI systems like Furhat into the customer service sector. The potential for optimization that arises from fusing human empathy with AI efficiency is also explored, along with ethical issues like data security and privacy. The results offer important implications for the development of AI and robotics, as well as their integration into various industries. The study concludes with suggestions for future research, including expanding the sample size and diversity, exploring various AI platforms, conducting in-depth demographic analysis, focusing on ethical considerations and user privacy, and investigating the impact of cultural factors.

## Conclusions
This thesis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of human-robot interaction, particularly in the context of travel planning with the Furhat robot. By integrating ChatGPT, the study advances our understanding of AI-enhanced communication in HRI and its potential implications for various industries. The findings underscore the importance of trust, user preferences, and the need for communication strategies that closely mimic human interactions. As AI continues to permeate various sectors, this research lays a foundational understanding of HRI dynamics, paving the way for future studies in more diverse, long-term, and real-world contexts.
