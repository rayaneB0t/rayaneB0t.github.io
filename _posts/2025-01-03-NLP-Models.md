> Reminder: Transformers are the backbone of modern NLP, leveraging attention mechanisms to process sequential data efficiently. Learn the basics in our [Transformers](https://rayaneb0t.github.io/posts/Transformers/) Guide.

Transformers are the architecture behind many state-of-the-art NLP models, enabling tasks like language understanding, generation, and translation.
Let’s dive into four NLP modeling approaches built on Transformers: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Causal Language Modeling (CLM) (Autoregressive Models), Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq), and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).

Popular Transformer-Based Models
Here’s how the Transformer architecture is adapted for different tasks:

Model	Type	Task Focus
BERT	MLM, NSP	Text understanding, classification, NER
GPT	CLM (Autoregressive)	Text generation, dialogue, code completion
T5	Seq2Seq	Text-to-text tasks (translation, summarization)
BART	Seq2Seq, Denoising	Summarization, text reconstruction
RoBERTa	MLM (Improved BERT)	Text understanding with better pretraining
XLNet	Permuted Language Modeling	Combines MLM and CLM for contextual understanding


## **Conclusion**
Each of these NLP modeling approaches serves a unique purpose in processing and understanding language:

MLM excels at tasks requiring deep understanding of context.
CLM (Autoregressive Models) is the go-to for generating coherent text.
Seq2Seq dominates tasks involving transformation of sequences, like translation or summarization.
NSP specializes in understanding relationships between sentences.
