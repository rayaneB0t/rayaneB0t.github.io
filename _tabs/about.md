## Passion for Generative AI & LLMs
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I’m particularly fascinated by Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Their ability to understand, generate, and transform data represents the future of intelligent systems. I’m eager to explore their applications in creative industries, conversational AI, and knowledge retrieval. My ongoing projects involve experimenting with LLMs to build conversational agents and enhance personalized user experiences.
