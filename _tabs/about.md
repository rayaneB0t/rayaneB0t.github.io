I’m Rayane Tarkany, a recent MSc graduate in Artificial Intelligence from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), Edinburgh, UK. With a deep passion for innovation, I’ve focused my academic and professional journey on exploring cutting-edge technologies like [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) and [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model).


During my time at Heriot-Watt, my master's thesis investigated trust development in [human-robot interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction) using the Furhat Robot, combining AI and psychology to address challenges in multi-modal communication. This project fueled my interest in creating systems that understand and adapt to human behavior, a skill set I continue to refine.

## Passion for Generative AI ##
I’m particularly fascinated by Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). These technologies, with their ability to understand, generate, and transform data, represent the future of intelligent systems. I’m eager to explore their applications in creative industries, conversational AI, and knowledge retrieval systems. My ongoing projects involve experimenting with LLMs to build conversational agents and enhance personalized user experiences.

## Let’s Connect ##
I’m always open to collaborating on exciting projects, particularly those involving generative AI and LLMs. Whether you’re interested in discussing AI innovations, brainstorming ideas, or building something impactful, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or explore my work on GitHub.
